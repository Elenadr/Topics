| A user is attempting to navigate to a website from inside the company network using a desktop. When the user types in the URL, https://www.site.com, the user is presented with a certificate mismatch warning from the browser. The user does not receive a warning when visiting http://www.anothersite.com. Which of the following describes this attack?  <br><br>- A. On-path<br>- B. Domain hijacking<br>- ==C. DNS poisoning==<br>- D. Evil twin |
| The scenario described aligns more closely with DNS poisoning. In DNS poisoning, an attacker corrupts or falsifies the data stored in DNS caches, leading to users being redirected to incorrect or malicious IP addresses when attempting to access certain domains. In this case, the user is experiencing issues with accessing a specific website due to a certificate mismatch warning, which could indicate that the DNS resolution for that website has been tampered with, potentially through DNS poisoning. Domain hijacking involves illegally taking control of a registered domain, which typically wouldn't directly result in certificate mismatch warnings but rather in unauthorized control over the domain's resources. |

| A Chief Security Officer is looking for a solution that can provide increased scalability and flexibility for back-end infrastructure, allowing it to be updated and modified without disruption to services. The security architect would like the solution selected to reduce the back-end server resources and has highlighted that session persistence is not important for the applications running on the back-end servers. Which of the following would BEST meet the requirements?  <br><br>- ==A. Reverse proxy==<br>- B. Automated patch management<br>- C. Snapshots<br>- D. NIC teaming<br> |
| <br>Given the requirements provided, the solution that would best meet the needs of increased scalability and flexibility for back-end infrastructure, while reducing server resources and allowing updates without disrupting services, would be:<br><br>A. Reverse proxy<br><br>A reverse proxy can efficiently distribute incoming client requests across multiple back-end servers, allowing for scalability and flexibility. It can also handle updates and modifications to the back-end servers without disrupting services, as it can route traffic away from servers undergoing maintenance. Additionally, a reverse proxy can reduce the load on back-end servers by caching and serving static content, thus conserving server resources. Since session persistence is not important for the applications running on the back-end servers, a reverse proxy can manage requests without requiring session affinity. |

| A report delivered to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) shows that some user credentials could be exfiltrated. The report also indicates that users tend to choose the same credentials on different systems and applications. Which of the following policies should the CISO use to prevent someone from using the exfiltrated credentials?  <br><br>- ==A. MFA==<br>- B. Lockout<br>- C. Time-based logins<br>- D. Password history |
| ---- |
| The policy that would be most effective in preventing someone from successfully using exfiltrated credentials is:<br><br>A. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).<br><br>MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification before gaining access to an account or system. Even if an attacker manages to obtain a user's credentials, they would still need to provide an additional form of authentication, such as a temporary code sent to the user's phone or generated by an authenticator app. This significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access, even with compromised credentials. |

| A security engineer is building a file transfer solution to send files to a business partner. The users would like to drop off the files in a specific directory and have the server send the file to the business partner. The connection to the business partner is over the internet and needs to be secure. Which of the following can be used?  <br><br>- A. S/MIME<br>- B. LDAPS<br>==- C. SSH==<br>- D. SRTP |
| ---- |
| Answer: SSH - SSH or (Secure Shell) is a protocol that enables two computers to communicate securely by encrypting the connection. Since the question is looking to transfer files over the internet to a specific directory, the FTP protocol can be used for the file transfer itself. As SSH can be used with the FTP protocol, this allows for secure(SSH) file transfer(FTP) over the internet. |

| A company recently experienced an inside attack using a corporate machine that resulted in data compromise. Analysis indicated an unauthorized change to the software circumvented technological protection measures. The analyst was tasked with determining the best method to ensure the integrity of the systems remains intact and local and remote boot attestation can take place. Which of the following would provide the BEST solution?  <br><br>- A. HIPS<br>- B. FIM<br>==- C. TPM==<br>- D. DLP |
| ---- |
| In this question, an attack has already occurred so preventative measures such as HIPS, FIM, or DLP would not be helpful. Also, the analyst wants to check the integrity of the system, and boot attestation can take place. TPM chips have mechanisms to prevent system tampering and boot attestation can be done with TPM based hardware to verify the state of the firmware, bootloader, etc. TPM is the best option here. |

| The Chief Compliance Officer from a bank has approved a background check policy for all new hires. Which of the following is the policy MOST likely protecting against?  <br><br>- A. Preventing any current employees' siblings from working at the bank to prevent nepotism<br>==- B. Hiring an employee who has been convicted of theft to adhere to industry compliance==<br>- C. Filtering applicants who have added false information to resumes so they appear better qualified<br>- D. Ensuring no new hires have worked at other banks that may be trying to steal customer information |
| ---- |
| Background checks are commonly used by organizations, particularly in industries like banking, to screen potential hires for criminal history, including convictions related to theft or financial crimes. This helps ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards and reduces the risk of hiring individuals who may pose a threat to the security of the bank's assets or customer information. |

| An engineer recently deployed a group of 100 web servers in a cloud environment.

| A technician was dispatched to complete repairs on a server in a data center. While locating the server, the technician entered a restricted area without authorization. Which of the following security controls would BEST prevent this in the future?  <br><br>- A. Use appropriate signage to mark all areas.<br>- B. Utilize cameras monitored by guards.<br>==- C. Implement access control vestibules.==<br>- D. Enforce escorts to monitor all visitors.<br><br>[Reveal Solution](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/comptia/sy0-601/view/3/#) | |
| --- | --- |
| Access control vestibules are physical security measures that require individuals to pass through multiple controlled checkpoints to gain access to restricted areas. By implementing access control vestibules in the data center, the technician would need to pass through authorized entry points, which may include badge readers, biometric scanners, or security personnel checkpoints, before reaching the server area. This would help prevent unauthorized entry and ensure that only individuals with proper authorization can access the restricted areas. |  |

| Which of the following is the BEST example of a cost-effective physical control to enforce a USB removable media restriction policy?  <br><br>- A. Putting security/antitamper tape over USB ports, logging the port numbers, and regularly inspecting the ports<br>- B. Implementing a GPO that will restrict access to authorized USB removable media and regularly verifying that it is enforced<br>- C. Placing systems into locked, key-controlled containers with no access to the USB ports<br>- D. Installing an endpoint agent to detect connectivity of USB and removable media |
| ---- |
| A. Putting security/antitamper tape over USB ports, logging the port numbers, and regularly inspecting the ports.<br><br>This method is a low-cost solution that physically prevents access to USB ports by placing tape over them, which deters unauthorized use. Additionally, logging the port numbers and regularly inspecting the ports allows for monitoring and detection of any tampering attempts. It's a straightforward approach that doesn't require significant investment in hardware or software, making it cost-effective. |
