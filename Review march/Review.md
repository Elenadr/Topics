User-agent spoofing is a technique used by attackers to impersonate a legitimate user agent or mobile application to bypass security controls. In this case, the back-end server was exposing an API that should have only been available from the company's mobile application. By spoofing the user agent, the attacker was able to trick the back-end server into believing that the API request was coming from the legitimate mobile application, and therefore, was able to bypass the security control that was supposed to restrict access to the API to only the mobile application.

## HIGH AVAILABILITY
A. Load balancing: This involves distributing the load across multiple servers to improve performance and ensure high availability. If one server goes down, the others can handle the load, preventing any downtime. Load balancing can also improve fault tolerance by ensuring that no single point of failure exists in the system. 

D. RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) can improve server-data fault tolerance by using multiple disks to store data, providing redundancy in case one disk fails. RAID can be implemented in different levels, with each level providing a different balance between data redundancy and performance.

#### Pretty Good Privacy
PGP is short for Pretty Good Privacy, a security program that enables users to communicate securely by decrypting and encrypting messages, authenticating messages through digital signatures, and encrypting files. It was one of the first freely available forms of public-key cryptography software.

### Data roles 

**■ Owner** 
The data owner is typically the company owner, executive team, or
department head who *decides which data is considered an asset and how that data should be protected.*

**■ Steward/custodian** The custodian (aka steward) is the person who *implements the security control based on the value of the asset* determined by the owner. The custodian is the IT administrator who performs common tasks such as backups, configuring permissions, configuring firewalls, and hardening systems. Remember that the owner determines the controls needed, while the custodian actually secures the asset by implementing those controls.

■ **Privacy officer** The privacy officer, also known as the chief privacy officer (CPO), is responsible for *developing policies that address employee personal data and customer personal data*. The privacy policy should specify how personal data is to be handled and stored within the organization.

## Multipath

 Multipath is a fault-tolerant technique used to enhance network reliability. It involves the use of multiple physical connections between two devices, providing redundancy in case one of the paths fails. It also improves performance by load balancing the traffic across the multiple paths.


### Cuckoo

open-source automated malware analysis system designed to test files in a safe environment and provide a detailed report of their behavior and characteristics. It uses various techniques, including static and dynamic analysis, to detect malware and is capable of emulating different operating systems and architectures. 

IC teaming is the process of aggregating multiple network connections into a single virtual interface for redundancy and increased throughput.
