any time you see "minimize recovery time", any answer with differential will be wrong. any time you see "minimize storage space" or "minimize backup time or bandwidth", look for an answer with incremental. While incremental backups are cost-efficient, it can time-consuming and complex to restore data. It requires the first full backup and all subsequent incremental backups to restore data. For example, a crash on Wednesday would require you to go through all backups from Sunday to Tuesday, identify changes, and restore them cumulatively. The process gets more complex as time from the last full backup increases.
