### NIC teaming

which is a method used to group multiple network interface controllers (NICs) together to function as a single entity. This is often done for redundancy, load balancing, or both. It helps improve network reliability and performance by distributing network traffic across multiple NICs. ^3d74a6

**File integrity monitoring (FIM**), sometimes referred to as file integrity management, is a security process that monitors and analyzes the integrity of critical assets, including file systems, directories, databases, network devices, the operating system (OS), OS components and software applications for signs of tampering or corruption, which may be an indication of aÂ [cyberattack](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/).

### ISO 31000
is an international standard for risk management. It provides guidelines, principles, and a framework for organizations to manage risks effectively. The standard emphasizes the importance of identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring, and communicating risks in a systematic and structured manner. ISO 31000 is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations, regardless of their sector or industry.

### Hoax 
A hoax is a deceptive message or information that is spread with the intention to mislead or deceive recipients. By educating employees not to forward social media messages from unverified sources, the company can reduce the spread of false or misleading information, thereby minimizing the impact of hoaxes.

NIST
following organizations sets frameworks and controls for optimal security configuration on systems?

### NIST

^cedf74

(National Institute of Standards and Technology) is the organization that sets frameworks and controls for optimal security configuration on systems. NIST is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce and plays a significant role in developing standards and guidelines for various aspects of information security, including cybersecurity best practices and security configuration.


### Command and Control 

^4f87d3

(C2 or C&C) - The weaponized code establishes an outbound channel to a remote server that can then be used to control the remote access tool and possibly download additional tools to progress the attack.

### RDP 3389

3389 is the default port for RDP connections. RDP is the protocol used to connect to windows desktops/servers remotely. In the scenario, the malware family is known to be distributed through manually logging on to servers and RDP would require a manual login to access the machine and be able to easily run scripts on the server especially through a GUI.

### Federation
Federation uses SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for authentication and single sign-on (SSO) between multiple systems or organizations. SAML is an XML-based open standard used to exchange authentication and authorization data between identity providers (IdP) and service providers (SP) to facilitate secure SSO. It enables users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials, making it a key technology for enabling seamless authentication across federated systems.

### Comunity

n a community cloud deployment model, multiple organizations or entities with common interests share computing and storage resources. It is designed for specific communities of users who have shared concerns or requirements, such as research projects, government agencies, or educational institutions. In this scenario, where several universities are participating in a collaborative research project and need to share compute and storage resources, a community cloud deployment strategy would be the best fit.
