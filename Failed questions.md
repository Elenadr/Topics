1. Business partners are working on a security mechanism to validate transactions securely. The requirement is for one company to be responsible for deploying a trusted solution that will register and issue artifacts used to sign, encrypt, and decrypt transaction files. Which of the following is the BEST solution to adopt?  

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> A. PKI</mark> 
- B. Blockchain
- C. SAML
- D. OAuth
---
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The main reason this is not blockchain is that blockchain is all about transparency. The transaction record is visible to all, and can be verified by the hash. Blockchain is not used to encrypt or decrypt anything.</mark>

###### Preventive&Detective

2. A Chief Security Officer (CSO) is concerned that cloud-based services are not adequately protected from advanced threats and malware. The CSO believes there is a high risk that a data breach could occur in the near future due to the lack of detective and preventive controls. Which of the following should be implemented to BEST address the CSO's concerns? (Choose two.)  

- A. A WAF
- <mark class="hltr-green"> B. A CASB</mark>
- <mark class="hltr-green">C. An NG-SWG</mark>
- D. Segmentation
- E. Encryption
- F. Containerization

<mark class="hltr-blue">An NG-SWG combines traditional secure web gateway capabilities with advanced security features such as advanced threat detection, sandboxing, data loss prevention, and SSL/TLS inspection. By deploying an NG-SWG, organizations can apply granular security policies to monitor and control web traffic to and from cloud-based services, ensuring that malicious activity is detected and blocked. The NG-SWG can provide advanced threat intelligence, content filtering, and behavioral analysis to protect against known and unknown threats. It also offers visibility into user activities, allowing organizations to detect anomalies and potential security breaches. A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can also help address the concerns by providing additional security controls and visibility into cloud-based services. A CASB acts as an intermediary between users and cloud service providers, allowing organizations to enforce security policies, monitor user activity, and detect and prevent unauthorized access to cloud resources.-</mark>
